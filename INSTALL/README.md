### Pychop3d Setup Script
This is a bash script designed to install the packages needed to run pychop3d. 
It can be used in Linux and Windows Subsystem for Linux. It uses the 'apt' command and
will NOT work in Cygwin. It must be run with 'source' or '.' in order to properly setup and
activate a python virtual environment.

#### Navigate to main pychop3d directory (where you cloned the repo)
`cd pychop3d`
#### Run the setup script using either
`source INSTALL/setup_linux`
##### or
`. INSTALL/setup_linux`

##### Note:
As long as this script is used for Good and not for Evil, I authorize anyone to use/modify it as they see fit.
